# Battleship


Welcome to my first cog. I made this little Battleship game, and converted it into where a bot on discord can use. This code "Game.py" is very messy still, but is being cleaned up after thorough testing. Any suggestions or issues, use the issues page and post them, thanks!

Versions:

	1.0:
		Now able to cancel the game with the words "cancel"
		Now able to take X and Y at the same time!
		New grid, which is also posted at the beginning of each game
		Now able to only respond to the sender of the command and to only respond where the command came from
	1.1:
		New Grid with Discord Emojies
		Added function of editing the embed instead of reposting
		Now deletes the asking of X and Y coords.
		Now able to prevent most cases of the bot malafunction with a improper message, able to catch the error
	1.2:
		Now able to edit the embed
		Added a timeout of 30 seconds
		(Beta) Able to send "is typing" message
		Edited embed( Turns)
	1.3:
		Timeout now works!
		Able to send the "is typing" message
		The board embed now shows your turns
		3 outputs at the end of the game, if you cancel, no input, and Game Over(and if you get all the ships)
		Output 1 - Send "cancel", it only says "Stopping Game."
		Output 2 - Wait for 30 seconds and no input, says "Error. No input, stopping game."
		Output 3 - When you don't sink all ships, you get the board where the ships were and "Game Over"
		Output 4(still working on for the end) - Basically congrats on hitting all the ships.
