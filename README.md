# Battleship


Welcome to my first cog. I made this little Battleship game, and converted it into where a bot on discord can use. This code "Game.py" is very messy still, but is being cleaned up after thorough testing. Any suggestions or issues, use the issues page and post them, thanks!

Versions:

	1.0:
		Now able to cancel the game with the words "cancel"
		Now able to take X and Y at the same time!
		New grid, which is also posted at the beginning of each game
		Now able to only respond to the sender of the command and to only respond where the command came from
